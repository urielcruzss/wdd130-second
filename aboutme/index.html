    <p>Currently one of the thing I love to do is to become better in what I do. I have been learning how to be eficient
        and humble at the same time. To do so you only need to:
    <ol>
        <li>work hard and...</li>
        <li>When succes come give it to God and give thanks and recognize your fellowmen.</li>
        <li>Finally, you need to be organize in you time work managment and in your realtionships with your spouse,
            family, friend, service and yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>I've been a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since December 2012. It's been awesome</p>
    <p>I testify that we receive according our desires, focus, faith and diligent that we put in what God has given us
        to be guide.</p>
